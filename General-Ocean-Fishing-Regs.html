<h3 id="FinfishGeneral">Finfish – Minimum Size Limits, Bag and Possession Limits, and Seasons</h3>
<p><strong>27.20. Groundfish Management Areas, Seasons, Depths, Exceptions, and Fishery Closure/Rule Change Process Described.</strong> Regulations that follow in sections 27.25 through 27.50 define fishing seasons and depth constraints that are effective within each Groundfish Management Area. These sections apply to take and possession of federally-managed groundfish species as defined in Section 1.91 and California sheephead, ocean whitefish, and all greenlings of the genus <em>Hexagrammos</em>, which are state-managed species known to associate with federal groundfish.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">(a) Depth Constraints: A depth constraint means that during the open season, the aforementioned species may not be taken or possessed in water depths deeper than the specified depth. Two specific definitions of “depth” apply off California. In waters shallower than 30 fathoms, “depth” is defined by general depth contour lines. In waters equal to or deeper than 30 fathoms, “depth” is defined by approximating a particular depth contour by connecting the appropriate set of waypoints adopted in Federal regulations (50 CFR Part 660, Subpart C).
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">(b) General Provisions.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">(1) Take and Possession: During any open season in any Groundfish Management Area, in waters deeper than where fishing is authorized or within special closure areas established within a Groundfish Management Area, it is unlawful to take or possess the aforementioned species except as provided in subsections (b)(1) (A) through (b)(1)(D) below and sections 27.25 through 27.50 of these regulations.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px;">(A) Transit: The aforementioned species may be possessed aboard a vessel in transit through a closed area with no fishing gear deployed in the water.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px;">(B) “Other Flatfish” as defined in subsection 1.91(a)(10), petrale sole and starry flounder may be taken or possessed in all depths year-round.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px;">(C) Shore Based Angling: When angling from shore (includes beaches, banks, piers, jetties, breakwaters, docks, and other man-made structures connected to the shore), all species may be taken or possessed year-round (See 27.50(b)(1) for exceptions in the Cowcod Conservation Areas). No vessel or watercraft (motorized or non-motorized) may be used to assist in taking or possessing these species while angling from shore under this provision.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px;">(D) Diving or Spearfishing: When diving or spearfishing, as authorized in Section 28.90, all species may be taken or possessed year-round (See 27.50(b)(2)) for exceptions in the Cowcod Conservation Areas). When boat-based groundfish fishing is closed, all types of fishing gear, except spearfishing gear, are prohibited to be aboard the vessel or watercraft (motorized or non-motorized) while spearfishing for the purpose of taking or possessing these species under this provision.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">(c) Closed Season: During any closed season in any Groundfish Management Area, it is unlawful to take or possess the aforementioned species regardless of depth, except as provided in subsections (b)(1)(A) through (b)(1)(D) above and sections 27.25 through 27.50 of these regulations.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">(d) California Rockfish Conservation Area: Within any Groundfish Management Area, waters that are closed for these species during specified times and/or closed in specified depths shall be known as the California Rockfish Conservation Area. See Section 27.51.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">(e) Fishery closure and/or rule change: When the department determines, based on the best available scientific information, that an annual harvest limit [optimum yield (OY), annual catch limit (ACL), annual catch target (ACT), recreational harvest guideline, or recreational harvest target] established in regulation by the NOAA Fisheries (National Marine Fisheries Service) for any species of federally-managed groundfish or aggregate group of federal groundfish species has been exceeded or is projected to be exceeded prior to the end of the year or that catches are less than predicted, the following rule changes may occur:
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">(1) The department may modify the seasons and/or depth constraints for any species of federally-managed groundfish or aggregate group of federal groundfish species, California sheephead, ocean whitefish, and all greenlings of the genus<em> Hexagrammos</em>. Season and/or depth modifications may differ by Groundfish Management Area, time of year, mode of fishing, or gear utilized.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">(2) The department may adjust existing bag or sub-bag limits or establish additional bag or sub-bag limits as needed for any species of federally-managed groundfish or aggregate group of federal groundfish species, California sheephead, ocean whitefish, and all greenlings of the genus <em>Hexagrammos</em>. Bag limits may differ by Groundfish Management Area, time of year, mode of fishing, or gear utilized.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">(3) The department may adjust existing size limits or establish additional size limits as needed for any species of federally-managed groundfish or aggregate group of federal groundfish species, California sheephead, ocean whitefish, and all greenlings of the genus <em>Hexagrammos</em>. Size limits may differ by Groundfish Management Area, time of year, mode of fishing, or gear utilized.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">(f ) Notice of closure and/or rule change: The department shall give the public and the NOAA Fisheries no less than 10 calendar days’ notice of any fishery closure or rule change implemented pursuant to this Section via a department news release. Anglers and divers are advised to check the current rules before fishing. The latest fishing rules may be found on the department’s website at: <a href="/regions/marine">www.wildlife.ca.gov/regions/marine</a> or by calling (831) 649-2801 for recorded information, or by contacting a department office.

When two or more persons that are licensed or otherwise authorized to sport fish in ocean waters off California or in the San Francisco Bay District, defined in Section 27.00, are angling for finfish aboard a vessel in these waters, fishing by all authorized persons aboard may continue until boat limits of finfish are taken and possessed aboard the vessel as authorized under this section or Section 195, Title 14, CCR.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">(1) The authorization for boat limits aboard a vessel does not apply to fishing trips originating in California where fish are taken in other jurisdictions.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">(2) A boat limit for a species or species group is the number of persons aboard a vessel that are licensed or otherwise authorized to sport fish in ocean waters off California, or in waters of the San Francisco Bay District, (see special conditions of Section 195, Title 14, CCR, applicable to operator and crew members of vessels licensed pursuant to Fish and Game Code 7920) multiplied by the individual daily bag limit authorized for a species or species group in those waters. With the exception of species listed in sub-section (b) above, the total fish aboard a boat may not exceed the aggregate per-person daily bag limit of 20 finfish in combination of all species times the number of anglers licensed or otherwise authorized to sport fish aboard the vessel. It is unlawful to exceed the boat limit at any time.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">(3) All persons aboard a vessel may be cited where violations involving boat limits are found, including, but not limited to the following violations:
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px;">(A) Over limits
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px;">(B) Possession of prohibited species
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px;">(C) Violation of size limits
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px;">(D) Fish taken out of season or in closed areas.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">(4) Upon completion of a fishing trip aboard a vessel, each licensed angler or person otherwise authorized to sport fish may not possess more than the individual daily bag and possession limits.For purposes of this section, a trip is completed at the time a person disembarks from a vessel and individual possession limits apply. Special boat limit provisions apply to persons fishing aboard commercial passenger fishing vessels reporting pursuant to Section 195, Title 14, CCR.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">(5) Species for which no daily bag limit exists are not counted as part of a boat limit.

</p>
<p><strong>28.85. Beach Nets.</strong> Beach nets not over 20 feet in length with meshes at least 7/8 of an inch in length may be used to take surf smelt north of Point Conception.
</p>
<p><strong>28.90.

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">(a) No person may possess or use a spear within 100 yards of the mouth of any stream in any ocean waters north of Ventura County.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">(b) When spearfishing for or in possession of federal groundfish species or associated species as authorized pursuant to subsection 27.20(b)(1)(D), in an area or during a season closed to the take of these species, no fishing gear except spearfishing gear may be aboard the vessel or watercraft.
